# Milestone-Assignment-2---Module-5-Principal-Component-Analysis

This repository contains the enhanced solution for Milestone Assignment 2, focusing on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and a Logistic Regression implementation for prediction using the Breast Cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets`. This version incorporates best practices for PCA, including pre-analysis quality checks and component interpretation.

## 1. Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>

The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**, available directly from `sklearn.datasets`.
* **Features:** 30 numerical features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
* **Target:** Binary classification (Malignant or Benign).

## 2. Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

To run this analysis, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `scikit-learn` (`sklearn`)
* `factor_analyzer`

You can install them using pip:```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn factor_analyzer



## 3. How to Run it.
Open Jupyter Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:
Bash

jupyter notebook
Create a new Notebook: In the Jupyter interface, click New -> Python 3 (ipykernel) (or your default Python kernel).
Copy and Paste: Copy the Python code provided in the solution ( file names: Andersen Cancer Center) and paste it into cells in your Jupyter Notebook.
Run Cells: Execute each cell sequentially. The printed outputs and generated plots will be displayed inline.

## 4. The results and insights from the analysis done in the notebook are shared in line 21.
